- Can we allow for default values to be set for both date values?
- Possible to get border color/thickness settings for visual box?
- Can calendar icon have its own color selection (or follow font color if not)?
- Sort & filter options could be removed, can't think of any instances where those would be needed. Probably the same for the date range dimension.
- How hard would a 'Always include Empty Dates' setup option be?

### BONUS POINTS

I have noticed many of the custom visualizations have fixed sizes, so this may not be possible or could be a big lift, but:  
Can the size of the visual box expand/contract with the size of the control box? Ultimately, this would allow a font size option (and left/center/right alignment) to possibly come into play as well.

Or maybe it would make more sense (and be easier) to just put a font size option and then let the size of the text drive the size of the visual box like it does now.
